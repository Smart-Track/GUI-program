# GUI-program
This repo contains the C# program for use in the Smart-Track. The program uses a clock to track lap/checkpoint times and receives characters over USB from the mbed to signify when a checkpoint has been passed.

This was originally meant to run on the raspberry pi, but an issue with the serial port object through the Pi prevented this.
